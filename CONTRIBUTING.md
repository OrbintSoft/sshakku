# Contributing to SSHakku

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This page explains the licensing terms
every contribution must follow and how to send changes. For the code's
architecture, how to build it, and how to run the test and lint suites, see
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Licensing and sign-off

SSHakku is, and will remain, made available to the public under the
**European Union Public Licence v. 1.2 (`EUPL-1.2`)**. Your contributions go in
under that licence and are also covered by our
[Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md).

In short:

- **You keep the copyright in your contribution.** The CLA grants a *non-exclusive*
  licence — it does not assign or transfer your copyright, and you stay free to use
  and license your own code however you like.
- **Your contribution stays public under EUPL-1.2.** It will always be available to
  everyone under that licence.
- **The copyright holder may additionally offer the project under other licences**
  (for example, a proprietary or OEM licence) alongside the public EUPL-1.2
  release. This is what the CLA's non-exclusive grant allows.

You accept these terms by signing off your commits. **Every commit must carry a
`Signed-off-by` trailer.** By adding it you certify the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO.txt) and agree to the [CLA](CLA.md).

Sign off automatically with `-s`:

```sh
git commit -s -m "Your message"
```

This appends a line in the form:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Use your real name and an email you can be reached at; it must match the author
identity of the commit. If you contribute in the course of your employment or
otherwise on behalf of an employer or other legal entity, your sign-off also
confirms you are authorised to grant the rights on its behalf (see the
[CLA](CLA.md), Section 3) — no separate paperwork is required.

To sign off every commit in this clone automatically, enable the bundled Git
hook once:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

It adds the `Signed-off-by` trailer when you forget `-s` — it never duplicates an
existing one and leaves merge and squash messages untouched.

### If the DCO check fails

The check verifies **every commit** in the pull request, so it can fail on an
earlier commit even when your latest one is signed. Add the sign-off to all the
commits on your branch and update the pull request:

```sh
git rebase --signoff origin/master
git push --force-with-lease
```

To fix only the most recent commit, amend it instead:

```sh
git commit --amend --signoff --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease
```

## How to send changes

- Open a pull request against the `master` branch.
- Keep the repository language **English** (code, comments, docs, commit messages).
- Keep changes small and focused; one logical change per pull request.
- Run the linters before opening the pull request:

  ```sh
  make lint
  ```

- Add or update tests when the project has them and your change affects behaviour.

## Reporting issues

Open an issue describing what you expected, what happened, and how to reproduce it.
Never include passphrases, private keys, or other secrets in an issue, a log
excerpt, or a pull request.
